# Cree Api

### Let's learn some language

This one is very likely going to be specifically cree, but I would like to focus on creating a platform that allows teachers to create and monitor a students success. This repo should be used to set up the basic class room.

#### Running this server

###### Activate the virtual environment

`source env/bin/activate`

###### Set environment and execute command

`export FLASK_APP=cree-api/cree.py`
`flask run`

_Refresh that venv knowledge_

But if you do need to install it again...

`python3 -m venv env`

test the venv

`which python`

_This should be coming from our local env path_
